Given a 2D matrix of size NxN, print the sum of the elements of all its diagonals.



Input Format

The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the N - the size of the matrix. Each of the next N lines contains N integers - the elements of the matrix.



Output Format

For each test case, print the sum of the elements of all the diagonals, separated by a new line. Refer to samples for more clarity.



Constraints

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= N <= 100

-100 <= ar[i][j] <= 100

Explanation



Test Case 1

Sum of the elements of the 1st diagonal: 4

Sum of the elements of the 2nd diagonal: 0 + -6 = -6

Sum of the elements of the 3rd diagonal: -5 + 8 + 1 = 4

Sum of the elements of the 4th diagonal: 2 + 7 = 9

Sum of the elements of the 5th diagonal: 3



Test Case 2

Sum of the elements of the 1st and only diagonal: -4



Test Case 3

Sum of the elements of the 1st diagonal: -2

Sum of the elements of the 2nd diagonal: 5 + 1 = 6

Sum of the elements of the 3rd diagonal: -4
